# Cycle2
Description: For this project, I have worked on an HTML project, Voting System, and made it into a functioning webpage with access to data tables created in phpmyadmin. Among its functionality, users are able to create and register using their email to place votes on who they believe is the Greatest Basketball Player of all time.

Dependencies: This project depends on data tables created in phpmyadmin, and the ccuresearch server.

Usage: This project can be used to view a Page on a few different athletes and use some of its functionalities to then place votes if they want to.

Future Work: For future work, I would like to potentially change my honorable mentions page to have a different look to it to make it more efficient. Next I would like once the user submits their answer it then takes the informations and reposts to the user to show what the current voting totals are. 

Major and Project Relation: I am an Information Systems major with a minor in Intelligence. One field that employees in this field work in is webpage development and functionality.
